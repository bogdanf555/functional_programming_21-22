    QUESTIONS:

    1.3.1 Can you name a language which has a REPL? 
            --- Response: Python
    1.9.1 Consider the expression fact 5 - 1. What result do you expect to get? 
            --- Response: 119
    1.9.2 Find two values for b, b1 and b2 such that b2 = b1 + 1 and slowAdd overflows for b2, but it doesnâ€™t for b1.
            --- Response: b1 = 4997, b2 = 4998
    1.9.3 Evaluate the following expressions in the REPL: (fib 40), (fib 45) and (fib 50). How long does each take?
            --- Response: fib 40 takes about 1 sec; fib 45 takes about 18 sec; fib 50 takes about 3 min 50 sec;
    1.9.4 Evaluate the following expressions in the REPL: (fibTail 50), (fibTail 100) and (fibTail 1000). How long does each take?
            --- Response: all fibTail calls take less than 1 sec;
